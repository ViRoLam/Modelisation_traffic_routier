# Modelisation du traffic routier

Welcome to the Microscopic Road Traffic Analysis project that is part of my Bachelor's degree studies. 
This project provides a mathematical and numerical analysis of road traffic from a microscopic perspective, aiming to explore the individual dynamics of vehicles.


It also incorporates traffic jams, reaction time, variable speed for cars, and explores the limits of the model.

You can find everything you need in the jupyter notebook file !

## Introduction
The project incorporates a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that outlines the mathematical basis of the traffic model, numerical modelisation techniques, and insightful findings derived from the analysis. 
By focusing on the microscopic aspects of traffic based on the __[Intelligent driver model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model)__, we strive to reveal detailed interactions and behaviors.

## Project Structure 

The project is presented in a jupyter notebook written in French.

1. Mathematical Modelling (Modélisation mathématique)
2. Numerical Modelling (Modélisation numérique)
   * 2.1 Example 1: Generic (Exemple 1: générique)
   * 2.2 Example 2: Gaussian Speed for the First Car (Exemple 2: vitesse gaussienne pour la première voiture
   * 2.3 Example 3: Red Light (Exemple 3: feu rouge)
   * 2.4 Example 4: Multiple Red Lights (Exemple 4: Plusieurs feux rouges)
   * 2.5 Traffic Jams (Les bouchons)
   * 2.6 Model Limitations (Les limites du modèle)
3. Time-Step Adjustment (Ajustement du pas de temps)
4. Addition of Reaction Time (Ajout d'un temps de réaction)
5. Conclusion (Conclusion)
